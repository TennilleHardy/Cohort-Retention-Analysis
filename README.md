# Cohort-Retention-Analysis

This Python notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of monthly cohort retention, a vital aspect of understanding customer behavior and loyalty over time. Cohort analysis involves categorizing customers into groups based on certain characteristics, typically the time they first interacted with a product or service, and then tracking their behavior over subsequent periods.

In this notebook, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

1. Data Preprocessing: We start by preparing our dataset, which likely contains information such as customer IDs, transaction dates, and other relevant metrics.

2. Cohort Grouping: Customers are grouped into cohorts based on the month they first engaged with the product or service. This step involves identifying the initial month of each customer's interaction.

3. Cohort Index Calculation: We calculate the cohort index for each transaction, representing the number of periods (usually months) since the customer's first interaction. This index helps in analyzing customer behavior over time.

4. Retention Rate Calculation: The retention rate for each cohort is computed to assess how many customers from the original cohort are still active or retained in subsequent periods. Retention rates provide insights into customer loyalty and satisfaction.

5. Visualization: Finally, we visualize the retention rates using a heatmap, allowing for easy interpretation and comparison across different cohorts and time periods.

**Analysis Overview**

The analysis conducted in this notebook serves various purposes, including:

* Understanding Customer Behavior: By tracking retention rates over time, we gain insights into customer loyalty and engagement patterns. This understanding can inform marketing strategies, product improvements, and customer retention efforts.

* Identifying Trends and Opportunities: Patterns in cohort retention rates may reveal trends or opportunities for business growth. For example, consistently high retention rates in certain cohorts may indicate successful customer acquisition strategies.

* Evaluation of Marketing Campaigns: Cohort analysis can help assess the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by examining how different cohorts respond to promotional activities over time.

* Benchmarking Performance: Comparing retention rates across cohorts and against industry benchmarks enables businesses to gauge their performance and identify areas for improvement.

Overall, monthly cohort retention analysis is a powerful tool for businesses seeking to enhance customer satisfaction, drive growth, and optimize marketing efforts.
